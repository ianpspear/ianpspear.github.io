    <h1 class="center">Finding the Vertex of a Parabola</h1>
    <p>To find the vertex of a parabola, you can use the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Find the x-coordinate of the vertex using the formula: <code>x = -b/2a</code>.</li>
        <li>Substitute the x-coordinate of the vertex back into the original equation to find the y-coordinate of the vertex.</li>
        <li>The vertex of the parabola is the point <code>(x, y)</code>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The vertex is the point where the parabola changes direction. The x-coordinate of the vertex is also called the axis of symmetry.</p>
